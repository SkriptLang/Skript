on sponge absorb:
	assert size of absorbed blocks is 1 with "Sponge should have absorbed 1 block"
	assert location of first element of absorbed blocks is {-water.loc} with "Absorbed block has an incorrect location"
	cancel event

test "Absorbed Blocks":
	set {_loc} to test-location

	loop blocks in radius 1 around {_loc}:
		set loop-block to air

	set {-water.loc} to location of the block 1 meter west of {_loc}
	set block at {-water.loc} to water
	set block at {_loc} to sponge

	loop blocks in radius 1 around {_loc}:
		set loop-block to air
