test "view distance" when running minecraft "1.21":
	set the view distance of world "world" to 5
	assert the view distance of world "world" is 5 with "World View Distance was not set"
	set the simulation distance of world "world" to 5
	assert the simulation distance of world "world" is 5 with "World Simulation Distance was not set"

	add 10 to the view distance of world "world"
	assert the view distance of world "world" is 15 with "World View Distance did not have 10 added"
	add 10 to the simulation distance of world "world"
	assert the simulation distance of world "world" is 15 with "World Simulation Distance did not have 10 added"

	remove 5 from the simulation distance of world "world"
	assert the simulation distance of world "world" is 10 with "World Simulation Distance did not have 5 removed"
	remove 5 from the view distance of world "world"
	assert the view distance of world "world" is 10 with "World View Distance did not have 5 removed"

	clear the view distance of world "world"
	assert the view distance of world "world" is 2 with "World View Distance was not cleared"
	clear the simulation distance of world "world"
	assert the simulation distance of world "world" is 2 with "World Simulation Distance was not cleared"

	add 10000 to the view distance of world "world"
	assert the view distance of world "world" is 32 with "World View Distance should be capped at 32 maximum"
	add 10000 to the simulation distance of world "world"
	assert the simulation distance of world "world" is 32 with "World Simulation Distance should be capped at 32 maximum"

	remove 10000 from the view distance of world "world"
	assert the view distance of world "world" is 2 with "World View Distance should be capped at 2 minimum"
	remove 10000 from the simulation distance of world "world"
	assert the simulation distance of world "world" is 2 with "World Simulation Distance should be capped at 2 minimum"

	reset the view distance of world "world"
	reset the simulation distance of world "world"
